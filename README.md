Join The Pipe . org Amsterdam (code for custom controller Concertgebouw Amsterdam)

This is the code written for a custom project, used in "The Concertgebouw"  in Amsterdam.
It runs on a Arduino Clone with rugged IO : A Controllino

https://www.controllino.biz/product/controllino-mini/

The system had 2 valves and 2 buttons to dispense water (one flat, one with bubbles)

The teach in mode allowed the timers to be set on the spot.

Pressing the 2 buttons for 2 .. 10 seconds puts the sytem in Auto-dispensing mode.

Pressing the 2 buttons for 10 .. 30 seconds puts it into teach-in mode (training the times for dispensing)

The code was created by me, Edwin van den Oetelaar, oktober 2016, for a contract, but maybe someone can learn from it now.

If you need special project code developed, give me a message ( edwin @ oetelaar dot com )

Also important, this code is MIT license now, no warranties whatsoever, it may set your house on fire or get your girlfriend pregnant, use it at your own risk or not use it at all.
